# Graduation Final Work: Multi-Modal Analysis Platform

## Introduction

This project is a comprehensive platform designed for the analysis of various media types including audio, image, and textual content such as fake news detection. It serves as a tool for researchers and analysts to perform multi-modal analysis efficiently.

## Features

- **Audio Analysis:** Utilizes machine learning techniques for audio classification, sentiment analysis, and content extraction.
- **Image Analysis:** Employs deep learning models for image classification, object detection, and feature extraction.
- **Fake News Detection:** Implements natural language processing (NLP) algorithms for identifying and verifying fake news content.
- **Modular Design:** The platform is designed with modularity in mind, allowing easy integration of new analysis modules and techniques.
- **User Interface:** Provides a user-friendly interface for easy interaction with the platform, including uploading media files, initiating analysis tasks, and viewing results.
- **Scalability:** Designed to handle large datasets and scalable for deployment in cloud environments.
